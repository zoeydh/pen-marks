    <h2 style="font-family: chapman, sans-serif; font-size: 45px; text-align: justify; margin-top: 1px;">THE PROBLEM WITH LANA DEL REY'S 'SOFT FEMINISM'</h2>
	  
    <p style="font-family: chapman, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; text-align: justify";>I, like many internet-bred teenagers of the 2010s, had a pretty thick Lana Del Rey phase. Right along with Marina (and The Diamonds), Lorde, and Arctic Monkeys — a lot of my personality was made from the kind of music that you’d find swimming in almost every Tumblr user’s “xxsadnessxx” playlist on 8track. It was mourning a wasted youth that you were currently living, wishing you could be experiencing life instead of lingering in the magazine-cutout-coated walls of your childhood bedroom.
</p>
	  
	  <p style="font-family: chapman, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; text-align: justify";>While all of the artists that I listened to as a teenager were melancholic, Lana Del Rey was specifically melancholic toward relationships. Back in 2014, she was like a sadder, cooler Taylor Swift. All of her songs were about women (including herself) and their interactions with men. Like I’ve said about Swift in the past, I really don’t find a problem with this. And I think that both Taylor and Lana’s criticisms of the backlash that they get for singing about their relationships with men are entirely warranted. That criticism was the basis of the viral public statement that Lana Del Rey posted on Instagram recently. Other women get awards for writing songs about men, so why do people criticize me when I do? My response could be boiled down to “that’s not the point babe”. But let’s dive a little deeper into what the problem really is.</p>
	  
	  <p style="font-family: chapman, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; text-align: justify";>To be completely honest, I don’t really have a problem with Lana. I hadn’t even thought about any of this until I read that initial statement. She’s obviously one of the most talented musicians today and, again, influenced my adolescent personality to an absurd degree. But while her music gave me the warm, fuzzy sadness that I craved, it also both reinforced and multiplied my shitty understanding of romance.</p>
	  
	  
  </div>
  <div class="column" style="width: 37%;">
	  
	<p style="font-family: chapman, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; text-align: justify";>For some background, I’m a gay woman who decided at a young age that I liked men because I had a lack of positive male attention and felt compelled to make up for it. The only problem was that, well, I really wasn’t attracted to men. So, instead of dating them, I fantasized about them. I created men in my mind and put them up on pedestals as beautiful, broken creatures that needed extra love that only I could give to them. This man and the relationship with him that I’d created were based on the media that I was consuming.</p>
	  
	<p style="font-family: chapman, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; text-align: justify";>He was aggressive like Han Solo. He had authority like Ezra from Pretty Little Liars. He was insecure like Dan from Gossip Girl. And he treated me badly because of it, like all of the guys that Lana Del Rey sang about. I know that in her recent statement (the first of many, really) she pointed out that she wasn’t glamorizing abuse — merely “a glamorous person” who spoke openly about abuse. I can definitely see what she was trying to say there and can even respect it. I don’t think that Lana Del Rey was in any way purposefully telling me, a fourteen-year-old repressed lesbian with daddy issues, that I should let a sad boy yell at me because he just hasn’t been loved hard enough. Nevertheless, she did.</p>
